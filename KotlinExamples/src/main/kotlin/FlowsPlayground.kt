/**
 * Playground demonstrating basic Kotlin Flow concepts:
 *
 * 1. A simple cold [flow] (run in [runBaseFlowDemo]) that emits two letters. It shows:
 *    - Builder code runs from the start for every new collector (cold flow semantics).
 *    - Collector delays apply backpressure: a delay in the collector suspends upstream emission until it resumes
 *      (see timeline example below).
 * 2. A [channelFlow] example (run in [runChannelFlowDemo]) that launches concurrent coroutines to emit values
 *    and collects them while mutating shared state (`counter`). It illustrates:
 *    - Structured concurrency inside the builder via `launch {}` blocks.
 *    - Threadâ€‘safe emission into the Flow via the channel provided by `channelFlow {}`.
 *    - Why the apparent "race condition" on `counter` does not occur: the collector block executes sequentially
 *      on a single coroutine, so even though values are produced concurrently, accumulation happens serially.
 *
 * Timeline sample from [runBaseFlowDemo]:
 *    0ms  Emitting A (builder starts)
 *  ~220ms A (collector finished its 200ms delay + logging)
 *  ~522ms Emitting B (builder resumed after collector then its own 300ms delay)
 *  ~725ms B (collector finished its delay for B)
 * This shows the collector delay holding back the builder's progress (backpressure), not running independently.
 *
 * Run the file's [main] function to print timestamped logs (uses the shared `log` helper defined in
 * `CoroutinesPlayground.kt`).

 * - The Flow is collected a second time with a custom [FlowCollector], showing that cold flows restart their

 * Inside the builder three coroutines are launched, each sending a number after a delay. Because `send` is applied

 *
 * The collector intentionally performs a read-modify-write sequence with an added delay to mimic a potential race.
 * However, no race condition manifests because the collector lambda runs sequentially; only the production side
 * is concurrent. The final counter is expected to be 6 (1 + 2 + 3).
